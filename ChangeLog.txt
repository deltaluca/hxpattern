   * added type-checking to enum switching (should be rewritten once haxe.macro.Context API is ready)

   * the full enum name format is not rewritten to the short from now on. Should work once haxe issue #224 is fixed

   * modified default case syntax to _ = <default>

   * organized user API into Hxpat.hx

   * Hxpat.gswitch does not take a 'switch' structure as input, but separate parameters

   * case values are separated with '&'

   * guard is separated with '|' (and should be paranthesised)

   * case expression is separated with '=', and should be put in a block for multiple instructions

   * moved unit test to 'test' directory

   * works with haxe r3398 (from svn)
